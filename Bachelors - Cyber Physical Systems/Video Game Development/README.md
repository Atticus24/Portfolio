# VincitAstra

This folder stores information about my contributions for the developement of our video game. Vincit Astra is a time-pressured FPS set in outer space created using Unity game engine. The game was originally intended to be in virtual reality, but had to be changed to due to unforseen circumstances regarding equipment access. Project received a B as the overall grade.
