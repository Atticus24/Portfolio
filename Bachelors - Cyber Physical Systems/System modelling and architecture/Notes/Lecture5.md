Interface class
Definition:
A class that implements all the methods in the class that extends the interface.

Advantages:
Data hiding (increased security)
Cleaner diagrams

Difference between interface class and abstract class
An interface can contain only method declerations while abstract classes can contain variable method declerations
Interface classes cannot have variables
You cannot override an interface class

Rule of thumnb: Use Interface diagrams when: - Wanna hide data - When multiple classes uses the same method(s)
